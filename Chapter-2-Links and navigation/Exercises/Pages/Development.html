        <p class="Informations">The lead director of Elden ring is Director Hidetaka Miyazak which also directed the creation of other well known masterpieces such as Bloodborne, The Darksouls series, Sekiro and Demon souls.<br>Production of the game began in early 2017, Miyazaki remained lead writer for the game's main storyline but gave Martin creative freedom to write about events that occurred before the main narrative. Miyazaki compared the process to using a "dungeon master's handbook in a tabletop [role-playing game]". As with many of FromSoftware's previous games, the story was designed to be poorly explained; the developers wanted players to interpret the story for themselves via flavor text and optional discussions with non-player characters (NPCs). Miyazaki said he enjoyed writing NPCs with more detail, believing they are more compelling than those in his earlier works<br> </p>
